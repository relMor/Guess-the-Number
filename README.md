# Guess-the-Number

WELCOME TO GUESS ME!
<hr>
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100
<br>
If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD
<br>
If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM
<br>
If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER
<br>
If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER
<br>
LET'S PLAY!
